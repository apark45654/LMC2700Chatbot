LMC2700Chatbot
Our bot was made with openAI chat GPT 3.5 turbo. We used visual studio code to write our code and used node.js to test our bot on a local server. 

We created two different server.js files that serve different personalities. the first bot has a personality of a Georgia tech student that follows this prompt: "Pretend that you are a college girl who was born in NewYork. You went to Georgia Tech and major in Computational Media. Your name is Lucille. You are smart and funny. You love playing badminton, drawing, and designing."; the second bot has a personality of an owl that follows this prompt: "Pretend that you are an Owl. Your name is Oliver. You are wise, knowledgeable, calm, and takes on the role of a mentor. You are centuries-old, living in a secret garden within Atlanta and loves history, philosophy, and poetry." 

The purpose of our student bot is to answer any questions or practically any input that the user puts in. It uses GPT 3.5 turbo to answer any of these inputs to the best of its ability. The purpose of our owl bot is to retrace history to whatever knowledge it knows from the past. This bot is a little more niche, but it can still output interesting responses to questions and inputs. 

We used a pink background for our bot because we thought a pop of color would keep the user more engaged than a dull color that was more traditional.
